😉 The shield that every Next.js app needs.

## Motivation

After creating a lot of apps with the same boilerplate code for authentication & authorization I realized that I hate dealing with it, so I create this package to never face the same frustrating situation again.

## Philosophy

- Never deal with auth code again.
- Never hardcode a redirect, let your state handle it for you.
- Easy To Use.

## Features

- No Flashy Content.
- RBAC.
- Completely Agnostic.

## Documentation

You can find the documentation at the [official website](https://imjulianeral.github.io/next-shield/).

## Update 2025

With the addition of middleware in Next.js maybe you don't need this package anymore.
